# FoxSub

## Summary

This project was developed for the course "Mobile Web Application" of the Stuttgart Media University by Rafail Antoniadis, Fabian Cuntz, and Johannes Str√∂bele. Subscriptions (e.g. Netflix, Spotify) can be managed using FoxSub. Each user can add, edit, and delet its subscriptions. Further, users have a dashboard which shows their monthly subscription costs and a profile where they can edit their cost goal.

## HowToRun
``` $ docker-compose build && $ docker-compose up ```

Fronend: Terminal "npm start"
Dev Docker (just mariaDB): Terminal 1) Navigate to root 2) "docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up"
